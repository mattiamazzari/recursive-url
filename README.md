# RecURLsive

This plugin implements a custom parser that allows to recursively scrape all the URLs in a given webpage.
This also gives the flexibility to define some keywords to implement a filter on the considered pages, max_depth, and timeout.
## Usage

1. Specify in the plugin settings the keywords of the pages included in the filter, the depth of the recursion and a timeout.
2. Specify the URL of the webpage you want to download recursively by selecting "Upload a url".
